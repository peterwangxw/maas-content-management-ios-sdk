 A `PWCMEFetchStructuresOperation` object retrieves `PWCMEStructure` objects with known IDs from Phunware CME. Use this operation object to fetch record zones so that you can ascertain their capabilities.
 
 If you assign a completion block to the `completionBlock` property of the operation object, the completion block is called after the operation executes and returns its results to you. You can use a completion block to perform housekeeping chores related to the operation, but do not use it to process the results of the operation itself. Any completion block you specify should be prepared to handle the failure of the operation to complete its task, whether due to an error or an explicit cancellation.

 This block is executed only once and is your only chance to process the operation results. It is executed before the operationâ€™s completion block. Your block must be capable of executing on a background thread, so any tasks that require access to the main thread must be redirected accordingly.

 This block reports an error of type `PWCMEErrorPartialFailure` when it retrieves only some of the structures successfully. The userInfo dictionary of the error contains a `PWCMEPartialErrorsByItemIDKey` key whose value is an NSDictionary object. The keys of that dictionary are the IDs of the structures that were not retrieved, and the corresponding values are error objects containing information about what happened.
